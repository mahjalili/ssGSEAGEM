<h3>Figure 2</h3>Characterization of the predictions of context-specific models for growth of <i>S. cerevisiae</i> under glucose-limited conditions.
A-C. Flux predictions of metabolite exchange (glucose, oxygen, ethanol and carbon dioxide) for changing dilution rates for glucose-limited chemostats by the conventional Yeast8.4.2 (A) and the context-specific models, created using GIMME (B) and ssGSEA-GIMME (C). 
D. Comparison of experimentally determined metabolic fluxes of the central carbon metabolism (E) and predictions by the conventional GEM (M), GIMME (G) and ssGSEA-GIMME (S) model at Î¼ = 0.30 h<sup>-1</sup>.
E-G. Correlation between the experimental data (X-axis) and model predictions (Y-axis) for different model implementations. Experimental data in (D) and on the X-axes of (E-G) taken from (Frick, Wittmann 2005 PMID 16269086). We normalized flux values to that of hexokinase reaction (v<sub>HEX</sub><sup>rel</sup>=1).

Experimentally determined (E) and predicted fluxes (in mmol/gDW/h) by the conventional GEM (M), GIMME (G) and ssGSEA-GIMME (S) in central carbon metabolism for carbon source-limited growth of S. cerevisiae at D = 0.1 1/h. Metabolites and reactions in gray represent interconversions, which do not happen during growth on these carbon sources. Points-of-entry of these carbon sources to the metabolic network are marked with a bar under the respective abbreviation. For abbreviations, see the legend of Figure 2.
