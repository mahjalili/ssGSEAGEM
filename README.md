# ssGSEAGEM

<h3>Introduction</h3><br>
The ssGSEAGEM introduced a new conceptual framework for transcriptional data integration into a genome-scale metabolic model, to accurately predict the metabolic phenotypes of a model. (such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>).<br>
This framework could accurately predict metabolic phenotypes and outperform the accuracy. We believe that this framework could be adopted almost to all data integration algorithms and be enhanced their prediction power.
